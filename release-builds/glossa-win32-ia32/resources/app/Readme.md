## *API

- One day, we'll develop a mobile data collection app, so those tiny sensor laden devices we carry around all day can collect culture and language data for later analysis. We'll have a fancy API to let those devices put your data into your culture notebook with ease. Smart coder people could use it too, for their own malefic purposes.
- One day we'll also have a self-hosted server app for backing up and sharing language projects on a LAN... specifically for those offline teams working in remote and un-connected locations.
